# Task project

This project was created with:

- React
- Vite
- Typescript
- Shadcn
- TailwindCSS
- Tanstack-router (for easy further expansion)
- Eslint + Prettier

I decided to go for dark-mode only as i am a fan of it, but implementing the light/dark modes is as easy as adding some providers that handle toggling "dark" class on and off the body tag.
